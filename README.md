# dotfiles
:wrench: - .files, brews, defaults.

Pre-reqs for `brew.sh`
- xcode developer tools (they include 'git'); however, install will be automatically triggered when trying to clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rollwagen/dotfiles
xcode-select: note: no developer tools were found at '/Applications/Xcode.app', requesting install. Choose an option in the dialog to download the command line developer tools.
```
- Mac App Store command-line interface ('mas')
  - signed into to AppStore for 'mas' to work (othwise any `mas install` will through a 'Error: Not signed in')
